# CreditCardCheck
C Program that validates credit cards using Luhn's Algorithm

Every credit card number is constructed using Luhn's Algorithm where the numbers have a relationship amongst themselves. Depending on the relationship and how the numbers are organized/structured, we can determine if the credit card is a valid instance of a VISA, MASTERCARD, AMEX, etc.

Simply run the program and input a credit card number. The program will confirm if its a valid credit card number and output which company it belongs to.
